🚀 Coca-Cola Stock Performance Dashboard | Power BI Project

I recently completed a Power BI Dashboard focused on analyzing Coca-Cola’s historical stock performance, and I’m excited to share the insights and techniques I used.

🔍 What the Dashboard Covers

✔ Closing price trends (daily, monthly, yearly)
✔ Volume analysis with YTD & MTD metrics
✔ Dividend amount & Dividend Yield calculations
✔ Rolling 12-month return percentage
✔ 52-week high tracking
✔ Previous month & previous year return comparisons
✔ Interactive filters, drill-through visuals, and KPI cards
